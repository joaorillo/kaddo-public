# Kadd么 Projects
Since 2023, I have been working on a startup that I've co-founded, called **Kadd么**, which specializes in 
solutions for supermarkets' e-commerce. Our goal is to enhance the user experience in online grocery
shopping in Brazil, since we've noticed a lot of challenges specially concerning selecting and comparing items.

I developed several solutions that have been implemented at Kadd么. Initially, these projects were hosted
in private repositories, but starting in October 2024, I am sharing some of these projects here in this public
repository, with sensitive parts omitted for privacy.

Of particular note, I independently developed an API (99% of it), which can be explored in the [`/api_kaddo`](./api_kaddo) directory.
One of its main features is presented in [this presentation](./api_kaddo/media/apresentacao_kaddo_pesquisa.pdf).

Also, on a collaborative project that uses this same API, we've developped an innovative interface
(patent request pending) which is presented at [this presentation](./api_kaddo/media/apresentacao_kaddo_interface.pdf)
and can be explored at [Kadd么 - Interface](https://www.kaddo.com.br/interface).
